# Algorithms of Choice
This repository contains implementations of decision-making algorithms designed to solve multi-criteria problems. These methods are widely applied in fields such as operations research, economics, project management, and decision theory. The code aims to help users understand and implement these algorithms in practical scenarios.


## Implemented Algorithms

1. **Saaty's Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)**
  A structured method that decomposes complex decisions into a hierarchy of simpler elements. It uses pairwise comparisons and calculates priority weights to guide decision-making.

2. **Pairwise Comparison Algorithm**
  A technique for comparing alternatives in pairs to evaluate preferences and establish rankings based on given criteria.

3. **Weighted Scoring Method**
  A decision-making tool where each alternative is scored and weighted according to the importance of each criterion, helping to identify the optimal choice.

4. **Preference Method**
  An approach for ranking and evaluating options based on defined user preferences, enhancing the decision-making process.

5. **Ranking Method**
  A technique for assigning relative ranks to alternatives by comparing their performance against various criteria.


## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash  
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithms-of-choice.git  
  cd algorithms-of-choice
```

2. You can go ahead and explore the implemented algorithms in the corresponding directories, where you will find detailed examples and documentation.
